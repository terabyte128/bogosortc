# [BogoSort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort), the best sorting algorithm!

Implemented here (badly) in C!

Compile: `gcc main.c -std=c99 -obogosortc`

You can change the output filename (the bit after the -o) to whatever you want, I won't get angry I promise. But you'll have to 
update the 'usage' section below to match your filename. 

Usage `./bogosortc [num1] [num2] ... [numN]`

Characters will be interpreted as 0's because whatever. 

Happy sorting!
